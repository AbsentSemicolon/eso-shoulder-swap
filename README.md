ESO Shoulder Swap
=================

Shoulder Swap Mod for [Elder Scrolls Online](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com). This makes it possible to bind an action to swap the shoulder the camera is currently over to the other one and vice versa. Useful when sneaking around and needing to peak around a corner quickly.

Installation
------------

There are two ways to install this mod.

1. Use [Minion](http://minion.mmoui.com/) and search for `Shoulder Swap`. This should find the mod off [esoui.com](http://esoui.com) and allow you to install it automatically.

2. Download the mod manually from [esoui.com](http://esoui.com) and follow the [instructions](http://www.esoui.com/forums/faq.php?faq=install#faq_howto_install) on manually installing a mod.

Usage
-----

You can go into the key bindings and add which key to utilize for swapping the shoulder. If using mouse with more then three buttons `Mouse 4` is a good option, or `Caps Lock` on the keyboard works well too.

*Haven't figured out how to set it for a gamepad yet.*

You can also use the `/swap` slash command if so needed. Mainly this could be used for debugging to make sure it's working.
